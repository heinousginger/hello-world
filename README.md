# hello-world
starting a boost from rwxrob, My goal is to learn more about data communication protocols, such as bacnet, through coding

I am a chiller mechanic that wants to learn more about how data is passed to and from my chiller to another source and between boards inside of my chillers. I also enjoy problem solving in my free time and this seems like the perfect hobby for me.
